If you want to pull all of California, I believe you can download the complete census dataset with all the variables from here and then you can select the variables you want:

I used DataFerrett to pull some data, its slow but it lets you select the regions and variables you want:
http://dataferrett.census.gov/

To explore variable options and definitions, I like to use this website because it has an easy interface:

Also, depending on what youâ€™re doing, it might be worth pulling the ACS data instead:
